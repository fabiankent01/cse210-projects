    For the final project I have chosen to do a Shopping Cart Program which demonstrates the principle
of Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. 
    For the project milestone I have been able to make the classes which will be necessary for the 
Shopping Cart Program:
*Product class
*ElectronicProduct class
*ClothingProduct class
*ToyProduct class
*FurnitureProduct class
*FoodProduct class
*Cart class
*ShoppingCartUI class
*Program class(Main class)
    I have added some additional member variables and methods which I feel could be really useful in some of the classes other than the ones in the original design.
    These classes have been implemented with the Parent class and Inherited classes having the 
planned member variables(attributes) and methods necessary for the program implement necessary
functions. With the Cart class I have implemented the necessary member variables and some necessary methods(just empty shells) and even
added some methods I feel will be useful which will with the ShoppingCartUI class to enable the Shopping Cart Program. The ShoppingCartUI takes
just one member variable and has methods with codes(some are just empty shells) from the design already set up. Some of the methods do not have 
any codes but have been designed.
